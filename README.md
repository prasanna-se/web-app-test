Improvements;

2.Move PageFactory objects to higher level of abstraction, to reuse code.

3.Abstraction for re-usable methods, to reduce duplicate code.

4.for future enhancements, json can be used as data format, and data models can be build around it, for serialization/deserialization.

5.API's like MockNeat, can be used for inflight data genaration.

6.Better names for variables/methods:-)
